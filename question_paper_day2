• What is CNV/CNA?
  - CNV stands for copy number variation, CNA for copy number aberrations
  - CNV's are found in most types of cancer and have shown to have an impact in cancer development. 

• How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and
so on)?
  - Progenetix is a cancer genome data resource established in 2001, aiming to represent genomic variation profiles in cancer
  - Progenetix provides CNA profiles, data annotations, meta-analysis and visualization
  - The data comes mainly from cancer studies reporting on experiments based on CGH, WES or WGS
  - The database incorporates multiple external data collections, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, GEO and NCBI.
  - The database Vol. 2021 contains over 115000 cancer samples with CNV data of cancer genomes grouped into 51 NCIt nodes such as breast carinoma or Acute Myeloid Leukemia
  
• Describe NCIt, ICOD, UBERON codes, and their relationships.
  - NCIt (National Cancer Institute Thesaurus) is a dynamically developed hierachry which allows data transfer between classification systems and resources, it treats diseases as histologic and topographic described entities.
  - ICOD (International Classification of Diseases in Oncology) providing organ- and substructure-specific mapping
  - UBERON () is a cross-species anatomical structual ontology system, allowing integrative queries linking multiple databases,linking related organs in an organism and also between e.g model animals and humans
  
• What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them?
  -
• What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix?
  - APIs (application programming interface) provide communication between several computer programs. In Progenetix Beacon is the API used to connect to wanted information in datasets
  
• How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles?
• What do you think should be improved in progenetix?
